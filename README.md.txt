How to play:                                                        
 Each round, you are given 5 random cards to choose from.            
 They are numbered from 1 to 10 and can be either Fire, water or Ice.
 Each player will choose a card for each round                       
                                                                     
 For your card to win a round:                                       
 -Fire wins against Ice                                             
 -Ice wins against Water                                             
 -Water wins against Fire                                            
                                                                     
 If you both choose the same symbol then the highest value card wins.
 If both the element and number are the same, you both get a point.  
 The winner puts the card into their card collection.
